# Notes

## Description

You need to write a function, that returns the first non-repeated character in the given string.

If all the characters are unique, return the first character of the string.
If there is no unique character, return `null` in JS or Java, `None` in Python, `'\0'` in C.

You can assume, that the input string has always non-zero length.

Examples

```
"test"   returns "e"
"teeter" returns "r"
"trend"  returns "t" (all the characters are unique)
"aabbcc" returns null (all the characters are repeated)
```
